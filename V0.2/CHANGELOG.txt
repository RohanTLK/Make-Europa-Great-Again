#Basic Ideas:#

Re-do this section of the changelog!!!

Things of note:
'Diplomatic' has been merged into 'Influence'.
Original Diplomatic now functions as a 'production' idea, is now called 'Infrastructure Ideas'
Economic now functions as a 'Tax' idea.
Trade is now more viable for non-naval nations.
Exploration gets 1 extra colonist in the finisher to make up for everyone else getting a free colonist. 
Quantity is now a viable counter to quality. Less attrition, less cost of stuff more MP regen.
Defensive and Offensive should be relatively even, and they are logically built for what their title implies. Offensive idea will be good at fighting wars away from home. Defensive idea will be good for holding your ground.

#Country Ideas:#

Halved morale and discipline bonuses across the board.
Reduced infantry and cavalry power by about 1/3rd across the board.
The purpose of the above is to have slightly less of a gap between land committed nations and nations that don't go land. Prussia and Sweden are still OP, however.

Nerfed FL and Manpower country ideas to balance with morale and discipline. 

CHANGED THE THEOCRACY GOVERNMENT MONTENEGRO'S FIRST IDEA FROM LEGITIMACY +1 TO PRESTIGE +1. THIS IS THE KIND OF PARADOX SHIT WE'RE DEALING WITH BOYS.

############################
#        2) Policies       #
############################

The main goal with policies was to have policies be a nice 'bonus' for after you've thought about your NIs, instead of picking your NIs to achieve specific policies. There should be no overpowered policies and you should not find yourself min-maxing NIs to get certain policies.
There have been too many changes to mention them all, but a brief outline is given.
Policies can be retracted after 5 years, instead of 10.

#Administrative Policies:#

The main goal here was to reduce the 'costs' of things, with the special exception of Espionage + Quality giving +2.5% discipline

#Diplomatic Policies:#

Changed basically all of the diplomatic policies to align with how the NI now functions as a 'production' NI. 
Also nerfed the influence NIs slightly so vassals don't become stronger than players...

#Military Policies:#

The main goal here was to remove any +morale and +discipline policies from the usual offenders (religious + whatever, economic + whatever)

############################
#        3) Economic       #
############################

Each tech in military now increases maint cost by 3% instead of 1%. 
Wartaxes buffed to 33% maint decrease but only lasts 1 year.
Bankruptcy reduces morale by 50% instead of 100%. 
Increased interest when taking a loan. This is to stop loan farming for buildings and coming out ahead economically from doing so.
Vassals give more money to their overlord but also have internal economic buffs so they can keep up with siphoning more money.

############################
#       4) Military        #
############################

Cost of making units increased by about 50% of their original price (not as bad as it sounds)
Cost of making most ships increased by about 10g, cost of heavies increased by 25g. 
Mercenaries are capped at a flat 42, non are given from FL. Bonuses to Mercenary availability are still applied on top of this (i.e. from Administrative NI)
Reinforcing costs a bit more.
Army/Navy Tradition gives a max bonus of 10% Land/Navy Morale, down from 25% which was ridiculous. However, high army tradition gives a bigger bonus to manpower pool regen speed. 
Prestige now gives max 5% Land/Navy Morale, down from 10%
Power Projection gives max 5% Land/Navy Morale, down from 10%
Base Supply Limits have been reduced but global manpower recovery speed has been increased, it will take about 4 years to fully replenish your manpower pool without any additional modifiers.
Everyone gets 1 extra free leader to account for the move away from doom-stack warfare.
Blockades are a lot more hurty.
All Morale and Discipline Event sources decreased to align with global morale and discipline decreases. Hopefully I didn't miss anything.
Reduced Cossack Estates Cav Ability Bonus to max +10%


############################
#        5) Combat         #
############################

Reduced supply limits given from tech by about a third
No penalty for manually retreating stacks from a battle. MORALE CYCLING IS A THING AGAIN BOYS.
The morale threshold at which a unit will shatter has been reduced to 10% of its maximum morale. This means you can manually retreat an army to the province you told it to go to, if the individual army has >10% morale.
Unit movement is locked at 75% of progress rather than 50% of progress, which was pretty dumb.
Scorched earth will now dessimate your province, but any armies sitting on a scorched earth province are going to have a bad time. 
Scorched earth lasts for 24 months instead of 40 (necessary to stop abuse)
Increased max NAVAL attrition to 10%
Increased max ARMY attrition to 20%

############################
#      6) Miscellaneous    #
############################

Revanchism decays a bit quicker.
Liberty Desire relative to overlord reduced a bit to compensate that they have increased income and stuff.
Positive Stability now gives slight corruption and autonomy reduction, and a 2.5% increase to tax PER STEP. Negative stability gives slight corruption and autonomy increase PER STEP
You can now send an alliance offer to a country regardless of your relations with said country. However, if you're rivaled you still cannot send alliance offer because Paradox hate Multiplayer.
HRE Reforms are rebalanced so they're good for both Emperor and members and removed the anti-multiplayer stuff. Now there is an actual reason to cooperate with your glorious emperor!
The Emperor (and cooperating members) will want to actually leave free-cities alive, as they genetate for Imperial Authority now. However, reforms cost 75 IA to pass. 
Nerfed privateer efficiency bonuses down to a max of 15%.
Burgundy's 'Form Netherlands' decision no longer feeds its cores to France. No, King did not force me to change this. 

############################
#       7) Buildings       #
############################

Increased the upkeep of forts by double. Forts give +X% supply limit and reduced unrest to province they are built in. You won't have many forts but you'll be able to move them around easier.
