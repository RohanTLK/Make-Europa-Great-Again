#           Description             #
#####################################
This mod makes several changes to combat, a few changes to diplomacy 
and a lot of changes to policies & army economy in order to make a 
healthier, tactically and strategically deeper multiplayer experience. 
The goal is to not change so much that you need to relearn the game, 
but simply rebalance existing mechanics so that there is always a 
strategic or tactical decision to be made, rather than having a 
'no-brainer'. Some 'behind-the-scenes' calculations are also adjusted. 
Additionally, the goal is NOT to make Multiplayer HARDER but to give players 
more options and a wider ability to showcase tactical skill and strategic prowess.
